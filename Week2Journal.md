# Reflective Journal – Week 2

> “Though the ethics of archaeological practice have changed over the life of the discipline (and have arguably become more robust), full consideration has not yet been given to how digital methodologies and the emergence of digital technologies have created new areas requiring ethical introspection.” (Dennis, 2021, p. 105)

This quote resonated with me because it highlights how digital archaeology introduces new ethical challenges. This week, one practical challenge was gaining access to graveyards. I had issues getting permission from graveyards so I ended up going on friday with two other students. A deeper moral challenge was feeling out of place recording graves. Even though my group and I showed respect—moving carefully and treating the graves with dignity measuring and analyzing them felt unusual.

Our work made me reflect on the responsibility we have to communities. Cemeteries are spaces of memory, and while digital data can preserve knowledge, it can also risk reducing personal memorials to research objects. Dennis’s point about ethical introspection reminds me that digital methods require careful thought about respect and impact, not just technical accuracy.
